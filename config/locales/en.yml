  hello: "Hello world from San Diego"
  steps:
    welcome: |
      Welcome to this Hydra tutorial. We're going to step through building a
      working Hydra application. We'll build the application gradually, starting by
      building our "business logic", wiring in HTML views, and then connecting it
      to our Rails application.

      "We'll generate a stub application in the %{conf_app} folder. You can change
      that using the --app option.

      This tutorial, a README file, and our bug tracker are at:

          https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-tutorial"

    install_ruby: 
      one: "Obviously, if you can run this tutorial, you have already installed ruby."
      two: | 
        You are running this using:

            %{ruby_executable}
 
      three: | 
        It looks like you're using rvm/rbenv/etc. We'll use
        this environment to build the application.

      four: |
        We checked, and it looks like you might be using a system-wide ruby.
        We suggest you use somethng like rvm [1], rbenv [2], etc to manage
        your ruby projects.

        "You can continue and hope for the best, or go install one of these
        ruby managers, which may make your life easier.

    install_bundler_and_rails: |
        "We're going to install some prerequisite gems in order to create our
        skeleton Rails application."

    new_rails_app:
      one:
        "Now we'll create the application."

      two:
        "%{@@conf.app} already exists. Either remove it or provide
        a different application name using the --app option."

    git_initial_commit: |
        "We will keep track of our work using Git so that you can see how
        the files in the project change from one step to the next. To see
        the difference you can open a terminal in the Rails application
        directory and run the following Git command."

          git diff HEAD^1..HEAD

        Or you can simply run the tutorial with the --diff option.

        Alternatively, you can use a tool like Gitx to see the differences
        in the code from one step in the tutorial to the next.

        First, we'll initialize our project's Git repository.

    out_of_the_box:
        "Here's a chance to look around. You can see the structure of
        a Rails application. In particular, look at:
           ./app
           ./config
           ./lib
           Gemfile

        If we launched the Rails application server, we can see the application
        running in the browser and you can see if everything is working."

    adding_dependencies:
        "Now we'll add some Javascript dependencies."

    add_fedora_and_solr_with_hydrajetty:
      one:
        "Fedora runs as a Java servlet inside a container like Tomcat or Jetty.
        Hydra provides a bundled version of Fedora and Solr for
        testing and development."

      two:
        "We'll download it now and put a copy into your application's directory.
        This might take awhile."

    jetty_configuration:
      one:
        "We'll add some configuration yml files with information to connect
        to Solr and Fedora."

      two:
        "And we will add the 'jettywrapper' gem, which adds Rake tasks to start
        and stop Jetty."

    starting_jetty:
      one:
        "Now we'll start Jetty"

      two: |
        "Jetty should be running on port 8983. You can see the Fedora server at:

          http://localhost:8983/fedora/

        And a Solr index at:

          http://localhost:8983/solr/development/admin/"
