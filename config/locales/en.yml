      Welcome to this Hydra tutorial. YAML ROCKS! We're going to step through building a
      working Hydra application. We'll build the application gradually, starting by
      building our "business logic", wiring in HTML views, and then connecting it
      to our Rails application.

      We'll generate a stub application in the %{conf_app} folder. You can change
      that using the --app option.

      This tutorial, a README file, and our bug tracker are at:
