  hello: "Hello world from San Diego"
  steps:
    welcome: |
      Welcome to this Hydra tutorial. We're going to step through building a
      working Hydra application. We'll build the application gradually, starting by
      building our "business logic", wiring in HTML views, and then connecting it
      to our Rails application.

      We'll generate a stub application in the %{conf_app} folder. You can change
      that using the --app option.

      This tutorial, a README file, and our bug tracker are at:

    install_ruby: 
      1: "Obviously, if you can run this tutorial, you have already installed ruby."

        You are running this using:

            #{ruby_executable}
          
      3: | 
        It looks like you're using rvm/rbenv/etc. We'll use
        this environment to build the application.\n
      
      4: |
        We checked, and it looks like you might be using a system-wide ruby.
        We suggest you use somethng like rvm [1], rbenv [2], etc to manage
        your ruby projects.

        You can continue and hope for the best, or go install one of these
        ruby managers, which may make your life easier.
